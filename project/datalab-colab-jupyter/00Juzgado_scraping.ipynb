Originally screen scraping was used prior to the wide use of World Wide Web (WWW), but it could not scale up WWW expanded. This made it necessary to automate the approach of screen scraping and the technique called ‘Web Scraping’ came into existence\n","\n","### Web Crawling v/s Web Scraping\n","\n","\n","*   The terms Web Crawling and Scraping are often used interchangeably as the basic concept of them is to extract data. However, they are different from each other. We can understand the basic difference from their definitions. Web crawling is basically used to index the information on the page using bots aka crawlers. It is also called indexing. On the hand, web scraping is an automated way of extracting the information using bots aka scrapers. It is also called data extraction.\n","\n","\n","### Working of a Web Scraper\n","\n","Web scraper may be defined as a software or script used to download the contents of multiple web pages and extracting data from it.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Lv6sbOmIX5eC"},"source":["## Important LINKs:\n","\n","https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_web_scraping/index.htm\n","\n","https://linuxhint.com/get_filea_metadata_exif_tool/\n","\n","https://dzone.com/articles/extracting-pdf-metadata-and-text-with-python\n","\n","https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-extract-data-from-pdf-forms-using-python-10b5e5f26f70\n","\n","https://exifmeta.com/"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"X61StaDfX2vt"},"source":["\n","\n","---\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4d14_YUFVQdv"},"source":["## Suppor LINK (Do instrucctions in following links):\n","\n","1.

Instead, we're going to go with the colloquial definition of data as **\"something whose value you care about”**. You won't find that in any formal treatment of the subject, but for now, it is good enough. Your name, age, and telephone number are data about you. Your bank savings, your address, and your parents' names are data that relate to you. We have data about everything, everywhere.\n","\n","## What is data science? (10 mts)\n","\n","Now that we know what data is, we can now ask: \"What is data science?\" Science, in the language of the scientific method, is:\n","\n","1. Formulating hypotheses, or guesses about how the world works, based on observations of the world around us\n","2. Validating or invalidating those hypotheses by conducting experiments\n","\n","Unlike the pure sciences though, working with data doesn't necessarily require conducting experiments (although it could!). Rather, many times the data has already been collected and organized by someone else. So the scientific method, as applied to data, can be summarized as: **\"Formulating hypotheses based on the world around us, then analyzing relevant data to validate or invalidate our hypotheses.\"**\n","\n","## What is machine learning?\n","\n","However, choice (d) of Exercise 1, as well as examples 1 and 2 from the above list, do fall into the bucket of **machine learning**. What does this mean?\n","\n","\"Learn\" means to \"gain or acquire knowledge or skill in something via experience.\" So one could frame \"machine learning\" as \"how a machine gains or acquires knowledge via experience.\" How does a machine gain experience? All machine inputs are essentially binary strings of 0s and 1s, which is really just – you guessed it – data! So machine learning is really just **how a computer acquires knowledge via data**.\n","\n","Of course, this gives no insight into the \"how\" at all; it just says that there is soemething that is done with input data to generate this knowledge as an output. To make a math analogy, machine learning is some function $f$ such that\n","\n","> $ knowledge = f(data)$\n","\n","and other than that there are no other real stipulations on $f$! So $f$ could be as mechanical as a simple mathematical function (say, the sum of all the data points) and qualify as machine learning. And in practice, this is what most of the common machine learning algorithms are, including:\n","\n","1. Logistic regression\n","2. Random forests\n","3. Support vector machines\n","4. $k$ - means clustering\n","5. Neural networks\n","\n","(You will learn about all of these later in the course.) This may seem disappointing, given how the media hypes up \"artificial intelligence\" and makes it seem like there is something \"smart\" going on with machine learning, but in fact many mechanical methods satisfy the conditions required to be classified as machine learning. This doesn't mean these mechanical methods are limited in usefulness – in fact, they are quite powerful if used properly – but it does mean that they don't resemble anything that we would naturally associate with human-like intelligence.\n","\n","## What is artificial intelligence? \n","\n","But the elephant is still in the room: even though some mechanical, \"dumb\" methods may qualify as machine learning, this doesn't exclude human-like, \"smart\" methods from being classified as such either. And semantically, this is completely true – it doesn't, yet people have chosen to name it something else entirely: **artificial intelligence**.\n","\n","But why? Why give \"smart\" methods an entirely different name if they can also fall under the bucket of machine learning? That is the question we will explore for the remainder of this module.\n","\n","Let's start by taking a look at an iconic demonstration of this so-called intelligence: AlphaGo beating the world's top human Go player.\n","\n","### What can machines do and not do? What about us? \n","\n","So, is there any sensible test we could use to determine if something is as intelligent as a human? There have been many proposals over time. The most famous aptitude test developed was the **Turing test**, named after the English mathematician and famous World War II cryptographer Alan Turing. In this exam, there is a human evaluator and two conversation partners: one machine and one human. The evaluator would conduct a conversation with each through a text-only channel. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test.\n","\n","Turing did not explicitly state that his test could be used as a measure of intelligence, but nonetheless many who came after him thrust his test into the limelight. Of course, the corollary of this is that if a computer can converse like a human, then it is effectively as intelligent as a human.\n","\n","## Conclusions & Takeaways\n","\n","In this discussion, you learned what \"data science\" and \"machine learning\" really are, in contrast to the misleading connotations that they are often given in public discussion. You also learned that \"artificial intelligence\" is a very murky term – nobody really knows what it is, and it's unclear if in its current focus on imitating human intelligence, that it is even a good use of our time and effort.\n","\n","Throughout this program, we will focus primarily on data science and machine learning, not so much artificial intelligence. Yet the philosophical questions surrounding artificial intelligence are fascinating, and we encourage you to continue pondering them as you become more involved in this new and exciting field."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Q1Q9nMCOojK3"},"source":["## Experiment Session 2"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"0dt6mamRjnSW"},"source":["#fluff, id =
